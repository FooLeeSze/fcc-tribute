      <ul>
        <li>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.</li>
        <li>A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility.</li>
        <li>Post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating.</li>
        <li>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).</li>
        <li>Playing mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey.</li>
        <li>A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.</li>
        <li>Cats can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.</li>
        <li>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces.</li>
        <li>Domestic cats' scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding.</li>
        <li>The claws on a cat's fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.</li>
      </ul>
